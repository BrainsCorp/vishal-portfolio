Hey, I'm **Vishal**! 👋 I'm an aspiring **Data Analytics and Machine Learning Practitioner** with a drive for continuous learning and innovation. I hold a PG Certificate in AI and ML from Humber College  and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Delhi.


### My Professional Focus

My core expertise lies in harnessing Python, Deep Learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and LLM Frameworks (Langchain, HuggingFace) to deliver data-driven solutions.

My most impactful work involved leading the development of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot** for a Capstone Project at Humber College. This solution successfully reduced the time faculty spent on curriculum research from an average of one hour to just **two minutes**. I focused on enhancing the retrieval system's effectiveness using multi-stage re-ranking techniques to ensure high performance and 95% content accuracy.

Before this, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern where I performed in-depth **NLP analysis** and built a Machine Learning model using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to improve content organization by 15%. I am proficient in using cloud platforms like **AWS SageMaker** and **GCP Big Query** to build and deploy solutions.


### Beyond the `<Code>`

When I'm not deep-diving into data or optimizing a model, I balance precision with passion by engaging in a few key creative hobbies:

* **Dancing:** A great way to clear the mind and stay energetic.
* **Music:** I enjoy listening to music and curating playlists.
* **Sketching Life:** I use sketching to observe the world closely and keep my creative algorithms flowing.
