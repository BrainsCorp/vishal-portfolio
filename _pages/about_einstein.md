Hey, I'm **Vishal**! 👋 I'm an aspiring **Data Analytics and Machine Learning Practitioner** with a drive for continuous learning and innovation[cite: 4]. I hold a PG Certificate in AI and ML from Humber College [cite: 25] and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Delhi[cite: 29].

### My Professional Focus

My core expertise lies in harnessing Python, Deep Learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and LLM Frameworks (Langchain, HuggingFace) to deliver data-driven solutions[cite: 34, 40, 41].

My most impactful work involved leading the development of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot** for a Capstone Project at Humber College[cite: 10, 12]. This solution successfully reduced the time faculty spent on curriculum research from an average of one hour to just **two minutes**[cite: 16]. I focused on enhancing the retrieval system's effectiveness using multi-stage re-ranking techniques to ensure high performance and 95% content accuracy[cite: 13, 14, 16].

Before this, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern where I performed in-depth **NLP analysis** and built a Machine Learning model using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to improve content organization by 15%[cite: 19, 21, 22]. I am proficient in using cloud platforms like **AWS SageMaker** and **GCP Big Query** to build and deploy solutions[cite: 42].

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not deep-diving into data or optimizing a model, I balance precision with passion by engaging in a few key creative hobbies:

* **Dancing:** A great way to clear the mind and stay energetic.
* **Music:** I enjoy listening to music and curating playlists.
* **Sketching Life:** I use sketching to observe the world closely and keep my creative algorithms flowing.
